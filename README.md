#### Short Description
In this 2.5D mobile game, players control a ninja who uses teleportation to navigate
through intricate levels and defeat enemies. The primary mechanics involve a drag-and-
release system for teleportation and a swipe mechanic for attacking.
Additionally, the game introduces a reflection mechanic similar to the one in **Gunner:
Gun Hero**, where the teleportation path can ricochet off specific surfaces. These
reflective surfaces are designed to be easily recognizable, adding a layer of strategic
depth as players must plan their teleportation routes to overcome obstacles and reach
their goals.
